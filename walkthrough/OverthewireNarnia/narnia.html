	<p>Hi, welcome to Oriyo's cool and comfy Narnia walkthroughs. I worked through the Narnia
	game in Overthewire, and after i was done, i made a python script using the pwntools
	library. I just log the details on how i finished the levels. I'll keep the passwords as
	hidden as possible, but obviously if you read the code for the scripts you'll find them
	there. This is still a work in progress</p>

	<h3><strong>Level 0 to Level 1</strong></h3>
	<p class="walkthrough">This one is a fairly simple level. As you can see from the image
	below <br/><p>

	<p class="walkthrough">There is a value that is initialized at 0x41414141 and you need to
	change it to deadbeef. The buffer can hold a maximum of 20 characters. So in order to
	overflow the buffer and go into changing the value of val, you just need to input 20
	characters and put \xef\xbe\xad\xde\, which is how deadbeef has to be put in because of
	little endianness</p>
	<p class="walkthrough">Making the python script was fairly simple for this too. All you have
	to do is make the ssh connection, execute the file and send the payload which is A*20 + the
	little endian of deadbeef. Fortunately for us pwntools allows us to do all those really
	fast. For running the file, you need to use the run command in pwntools, and then do
	recvuntill(':') because you want to receive the code untill it asks for input. And then you
	send the payload by using the sendline command in pwntools. The output from running the
	pwntools is given below</p>
